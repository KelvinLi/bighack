Background
----------

The idea is simple: there's an ant on an infinite lattice. The ant moves
in a straight line one lattice point at a time. It keeps an internal
counter for each step; if the count is a prime number, the ant turns
left and advances one step.  Otherwise it advances in the same
direction. ThunderAnt produces plots of this ant's journey.

We the original authors (Kelvin Li, Kenneth Lin, Michael Lin) initially
developed ThunderAnt at the 2012 Cal vs. Stanford "Big Hack" Hack-a-thon.
ThunderAnt is publicly available in hopes that it might be useful,
educational, or entertaining. If you are interested in contributing, please

Setup
-----

1. The C implementation of ThunderAnt requires libpng and libpari.
Platform-specific instructions are not provided here, nor are the library
source or binaries distributed with ThunderAnt.

2. In the c-implement/ directory, run make.

3. Run "./bh -100 100 100 -100"

There should now be a file called "hi.png". Open and enjoy!

4. For a larger plot, try: "bh -4640 1380 121 -545"

ThunderAnt is known to build and run on Debian GNU/Linux.

Remarks
-------

ThunderAnt has two implementations, C and Python. The C implementation
is *fast* but produces static PNG images. The Python implementation uses
tkinter to present an interactive interface.

Only prime numbers are currently supported. Extending to other integer
sequences, or even representing multiple sequences simultaneously, would be
neat ideas.
