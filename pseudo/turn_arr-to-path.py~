    """Takes an strictly-increasing set turn_arr (ie. the input from
    the prime number generator or other generator) and tests the
    natural numbers on them. If the number tested is in turn_arr, then
    tell the "ant" to turn left. Otherwise, continue going straight.
    In either case, the path the "ant" takes is added to a hash table.
    If the path the ant takes is already in the hash table (ie. the
    "ant" takes a path that it has taken before), then add to the
    count of the entry in the hash table. Finally, the function
    returns a hash table of the path the ant took consisting of the
    form:
